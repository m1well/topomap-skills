"""Public methods with their full signature, for a whole directory of files at once.

    python3 funs.py $(rg -l '@Service' --glob '**/*.kt')

A signature runs over several lines as readily as a constructor does, and a Kotlin
expression body (`fun x() = repo.findAll()`) would drag half the method into the
signature, so both are cut. Indentation is not assumed to be two spaces - ktfmt and
ktlint disagree about that, and a wrong guess silently finds nothing.

What is left out: everything private, protected or internal, `equals` / `hashCode` /
`toString`, Java's generated accessors, and anything nested deeper than a direct
member. What is kept: every method of an interface, whether or not it says public -
on a Spring Data repository the derived query name *is* the documentation.

**Kotlin `getX()` / `isX()` methods are kept.** They are ordinary method names on a
service, not accessors - a real Kotlin accessor is `val x get() = ...` and carries no
`fun` at all. Dropping them cost `AdminRaceService` four of its six methods once, and
nothing said so.

Every file is measured twice, and the second measurement does not share a line of
logic with the first: the parser works off indentation, the check works off brace
depth and counts the `fun` that sit directly in a class body. A mismatch goes to
stderr - **fewer signatures than declarations means the extraction failed**, not that
the class has few methods. Nothing else in the toolchain can notice that: the model
has no idea how many methods the file had.

The `doc` line in the model is yours to write. This only saves you the typing of the
signature.
